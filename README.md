Hi! This is the repository for my personal website. I've made this open source
mostly so folks can take a look and learn from the code. I've tried to 
document as much as I can, but there may be a few things that aren't clear. It
happens.

If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue. I'm happy to try and
answer it when I have time. And if you'd like to learn more about me, check
out the site at https://loveandcoding.com/
