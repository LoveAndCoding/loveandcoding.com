				<h2>Who I Am</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Alexis, and I use she/her or they/them pronouns.
					Just like this website, my life is chock-full of love and
					code, and I like to share as much of both as I can. With
					those things I hope to make the world a better place, even
					if just a little.
				</p>

				<div class="love-header">
					<h2>Love as Input</h2>
					<p>Here's a few things I love</p>
				</div>

				<div class="love-section">
					<h3>Reading</h3>
					<p>
						I
						<a href="goodreads.com/loveandreading">love to read</a>,
						and usually go through about 50-60 books a year. These
						days I mostly do audiobooks, a habit I picked up from
						when I used to have long commutes
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="love-section">
					<h3>Theater</h3>
					<p>
						Going to Broadway shows is one of my most favorite ways
						to spend a night out. I'm especially a sucker for
						musicals.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="love-section">
					<h3>Games</h3>
					<p>
						For a night in, playing games with friends or my partner
						is just a wonderful way to spend time. And I play games
						of both the board and video varieties.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="love-section">
					<h3>Learning</h3>
					<p>
						Learning and trying new things is always an adventure. I
						love to try my hand at new projects or skills so that I
						can grow and improve.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="love-section">
					<h3>Myself</h3>
					<p>
						It took a long time for me to come to terms with myself,
						but I've finally learned to love myself. So much so,
						that I wrote myself (and the world)
						<a href="https://alexis.lgbt/">a letter</a> about it.
					</p>

				<h2>Coding as Output</h2>

				<h3>For Myself</h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes it's most rewarding to work on little projects for
					myself. Beyond
					<a href="https://github.com/LoveAndCoding/loveandcoding.com"
						>this site</a
					>, here's a few things I am working on now, or have worked
					on in the past, that I absolutely love.

				<h3>For Others</h3>

					living. Here are just some of the places I've worked, and
