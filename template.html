		<!--
			Hi!
			I'm Alexis, and welcome to my personal site. So nice of you to stop
			by and to check out the code.

			First, I'll start by saying if you'd like to see all of the code,
			it's available on GitHub at
			https://github.com/LoveAndCoding/loveandcoding.com

			Secondly, I'll say if you want to find out more about how this was
			made or information about why in the world I decided to design 8
			different versions of my personal website, check out the README in
			the repository linked above. It has all the details.

			And finally, if you'd just like to take a tour through the code,
			please do! This code and all of the various pecies of the site were
			created to be explored and learned from.

			If you find an issue with the site, the code, or the documentation,
			feel free to open an issue in the above repository and let me know.

			Thanks again for stopping by!
			Love,
			Alexis

				<h2>Who I Am</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Alexis, and I use she/her or they/them pronouns.
					Just like this website, my life is chock-full of love and
					code, and I like to share as much of both as I can. With
					those things I hope to make the world a better place, even
					if just a little.

				<h3>For Myself</h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes it's most rewarding to work on little projects for
					myself. Beyond
					<a href="https://github.com/LoveAndCoding/loveandcoding.com"
						>this site</a
					>, here's a few things I am working on now, or have worked
					on in the past, that I absolutely love.
				</p>

				<h3>For Others</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to code that I do just for me, I also code for a
					living. Here are just some of the places I've worked, and
					some of the projects I've worked on.
