		<!--
			Hi!
			I'm Alexis, and welcome to my personal site. So nice of you to stop
			by and to check out the code.

			First, I'll start by saying if you'd like to see all of the code,
			it's available on GitHub at
			https://github.com/LoveAndCoding/loveandcoding.com

			Secondly, I'll say if you want to find out more about how this was
			made or information about why in the world I decided to design 8
			different versions of my personal website, check out the README in
			the repository linked above. It has all the details.

			And finally, if you'd just like to take a tour through the code,
			please do! This code and all of the various pecies of the site were
			created to be explored and learned from.

			If you find an issue with the site, the code, or the documentation,
			feel free to open an issue in the above repository and let me know.

			Thanks again for stopping by!
			Love,
			Alexis
